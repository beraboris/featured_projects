== Redmine/Chiliproject Featured Projects Plugin

This plugin allows the redmine/chiliproject administrator to mark any project he wants as "featured" (notice that this is an "admin" right, not a project administrator right).

It also changes the redmine home page to show a "featured projects" box. This box replaces the default "Latest projects" box.

== Installation

1. Copy the plugin directory into the vendor/plugins directory

2. Migrate plugin:
   rake db:migrate_plugins

3. Start Redmine

Installed plugins are listed and can be configured from 'Admin -> Plugins' screen.

== Credits

Development of this plugin was financed by the Open Hardware Repository - www.ohwr.org
